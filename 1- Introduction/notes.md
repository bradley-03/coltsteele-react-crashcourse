## What is React?
React is a front-end library that allows you to create lots of small components
that help build bigger components.

## What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write markup that looks
like HTML in JavaScript.
Babel transpiles JSX into "real" JavaScript, which then renders onto the page.

## Structure of a React App
Typically, the top level component of your application is "App". All the components
that you create will eventually be rendered as one, conventionally called "App".
The App component is renders inside the "root" div in the HTML.
