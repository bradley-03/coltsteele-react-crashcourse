## Vite 

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used to quickly create React apps locally.
To create an app, all you need to do it run one command and follow the setup process.
```
npm create vite@latest
```
This will create a basic environment for you.
You can then start the server by moving into the project directory, then running
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start a live server and the address will be provided in the terminal.
