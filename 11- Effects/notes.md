## useEffect Hook
The React useEffect hook is used for side effects in functional components.

-It runs code after the component renders.
-Helps manage things like data fetching and DOM manipulation.
-Takes two arguments: a function and an array of dependencies.
-The function contains the code to run after rendering.
-The array specifies when the effect should run based on changes in dependencies.
-An empty array means the effect runs only once.
-Omitting the array causes the effect to run after every render.

In summary, useEffect is used to handle actions that should occur after rendering, and you can control when it runs by specifying its dependencies.
